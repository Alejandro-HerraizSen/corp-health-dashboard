## Data, scoring and transparency
### Inputs
- Sample data at templates
- Live data pulled from the SEC Company Facts API for common us-gaap concepts
### Metrics
- Profitability: EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, ROA, ROE
- Liquidity: Current ratio, Quick ratio
- Leverage: Debt to Equity, Net debt to EBITDA
- Cash generation: Operating cash flow margin, Free cash flow margin
- Valuation helper: EV to EBITDA for context
### Scoring method
- Z-score metrics across the current peer set
- Combine into a composite score on a 0 to 100 scale with user-controlled weights
- For leverage, lower is better, so the model inverts that component
### Assumptions
- Latest full fiscal year per company is used when multiple years are available
- Missing values are handled conservatively and shown for review
- Educational project. Not investment advice
---
## Power BI handoff

- The app saves `outputs/metrics_long.csv`.
- Open Power BI Desktop, import that CSV, and build the one-pager using `dashboards/PowerBI_Readme.md`.
- Optional artifacts to include in a release:
  - `dashboards/CorporateHealth.pbix`
  - `dashboards/CorporateHealth.pdf`

## What this demonstrates

- Business framing that matches consulting and PE workflows
- Clean data ingestion, normalization, and transparent scoring
- Analyst-ready exports and an exec-friendly view
- Ability to blend data science and finance into a usable product
